# Radiative corrections of the spin foam propagator

**Interact with the file "configs_to_compute.jl" in order to specify the data of the computation.**

***The codes are parallelized on the available cores.***

*It is advisable for the performance to use a number of workers equal to or less than the physical number of cores present on the system.*

A full list of the julia packages used in this code are: TODO: ancora da scrivere 

*Before executing the code, all packages must be installed.*

**Notice that the julia's Just-in-Time compiler is such that the first execution of functions is considerably slower that following ones, and it also allocates much more memory**. To avoid this, you can use the [DaemonMode package](https://github.com/dmolina/DaemonMode.jl).


## Usage:

TODO: ancora da decidere
